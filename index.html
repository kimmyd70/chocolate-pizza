                For the fig-swirl: Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan.
                 Add brown sugar and stir to dissolve. Halve all of the figs
                 and toss in the sauce pan with water and lemon juice. Cook
                 over medium heat, stirring frequently, until you have a chunky
                 jammy mixture. Add salt with one or two stirs, set aside and 
                 let cool completely.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Ice Cream: In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk, and granulated sugar
                until sugar is completely dissolved and the milk is just barely lukewarm.
                Whisk in the egg yolks. Set mixture in the fridge and wait until the 
                fig mixture is cooled.

            </p>
            <p>
                Using an ice cream machine, pour liquids into the frozen basin and process
                according to manufacturer instructions, i.e., let spin and thicken for 
                20 min before adding mascarpone, fig jam mixture, and the nuts. Continue
                to process for +/- 10 minutes. Pour semi-frozen mixture into a pyrex dish
                or glass tupperware. Freeze for at least 2 hours before serving.
